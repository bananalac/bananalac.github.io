This is a website for web-based LAC tools.

## Front-end
I used a simple responsive front-end for website, with help of [ZZZ Code AI](https://zzzcode.ai/) .

### âš  You do not have the right to use, edit, change the implementation of the front end. Also, you do not have the right to use the signs and logo (BananaLAC). The right of the website creator for the front end components is reserved.

#### Instead, use our codes:
1. [LAC Triggerbox Linter](https://bananalac.github.io/linter)
2. [LAC SaveData Editor](https://bananalac.github.io/editor)
